              <h2>Fluctuations on Liberty</h2>
              <p><p>US federal prosecutors have charged the Hollywood actors Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, along with almost 50 other people, over a $25m scheme to help wealthy Americans buy their children’s way into elite universities including Yale, Georgetown, Stanford and the University of Southern California.</p><p>Huffman appeared in court in Los Angeles on Tuesday afternoon, where a magistrate judge said she could be released on a $250,000 bond. The judge ordered the Desperate Housewives star to restrict her travel to the continental United States. Huffman’s husband, the actor William H Macy, attended his wife’s initial court appearance. He has not been charged and authorities have not said why.</p><p>Two hundred FBI agents were involved in the investigation, dubbed “Operation Varsity Blues”, which exposed how parents bribed college coaches and insiders at testing centers to get their children into some of the most elite schools in the country, federal prosecutors said on Tuesday.
How did the US college admissions scheme work and who was charged?

Dozens, including Huffman, were arrested by midday in what authorities called a “conspiracy nationwide in scope”.

Their lawyers declined to comment after their clients appeared before a magistrate judge to face charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.</p><p>Abbott is the New York founder of a food and beverage packaging company. Caplan is the co-chairman of the Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher law firm, which has 700 lawyers in 10 offices in six countries. Manuel Henriquez, the chairman of Hercules Capital Inc, shook his head repeatedly in court. Elizabeth Henriquez appeared distressed, repeatedly running her hands through her hair.</p></p>
