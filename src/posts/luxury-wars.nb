All wars for centuries have been luxury wars, which is to say, wars whose generative idea was purely imaginary, formed by a few, and not by a real need of the majority, &ndash; and whose profits were only for a minority; those few not being all of the victorious people. The indispensable popular excitement was created by way of publicity, education, artificial agitation. And History &ndash; &ndash;

It would be another chapter of history to be write, the history of the act of creating the will/fervor for war &ndash; with all the supporting documents.
