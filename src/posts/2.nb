The Old Woman

I am very old, and live in an intermediate world, nearly in balance with every instant and every circumstance. Though I touch you, I am very far. The same moment means quite a different thing for you and for me. My memory is a fully completed house. This magic house may disappear at a moment's notice, as soon as nothing more can be added. All possible projects have either been brought to completion or abandoned. I have only one new act still to perform.

I am difficult regarding the light, noise, the taste of food. Everything that happens now is already known to me, or is unknowable.
