*Mr Teste's prayer:* Lord, I was in the void, infinitely serene. I was disturbed from that state and thrown into the strange carnival of life. So I was given all I needed to suffer, enjoy, understand and be mistaken, but these gifts were bestowed in unequal measure.

I see you as master of the dark I look into when I think, and against which my last thought will be inscribed.

Grant, O Darkness â€“

I confess I have made an idol of my mind, but I found none other. I dealt with it through gifts and insults. Not like something of mine.
