Tide. Twice in twenty-four hours you adore yourself, and twice disdain. I am all, I am nothing, follow and cause each other, and each is  only the other's simple and necessary alternative, without importance.

Perhaps for any given feeling we can find a period of time that contains the opposite feeling for the same object. And were life long enough, everything in the end would be both desired and hated; every opinion would be considered both true and false.

You like tobacco, music... That's only because you haven't lived long enough to have the opposite taste.
